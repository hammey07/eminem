			<h3>Early Career (1992-1999)</h3>
			<p>Eminem was recruited by several rap groups after achieving better reputation in his rap career. He was first recruited by a band named ‘New Jacks’. After getting disbanded from the group he found a place in another group named <a  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Intent_(group)">Soul Intent</a>. Soul Intent also released a single called <a  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Intent_(EP)">self-titled EP</a> featuring proof in 1995. Eminem then teamed up with a few friends including proof to make the group <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D12">“THE DIRTY DOZEN(D12)"</a>.</p>
			<blockquote cite="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/eminem/biography">
				According to <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/eminem/biography">Rollingstone</a> Eminem released his first solo album, Infinite, on the local Web Entertainment label in 1996. It failed to garner much attention, but the followup, 1998's The Slim Shady EP, so impressed super-producer Dr. Dre that he signed Eminem to his Interscope imprint, Aftermath. The EP was expanded into the Dre-coproduced The Slim Shady LP, which debuted on the pop chart at Number Three in February 1999 and went on to sell three million copies and win Eminem a Grammy for Best Rap Album. Like the EP before it, the album showcased Eminem's maniacal alter ego Slim Shady — a homicidal comedian through whom Mathers enacted his most outrageous and perverse revenge fantasies. The catchy lead single "My Name Is" was a huge crossover success, climbing to Number 36 on the Hot 100 and eventually winning a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance. Meanwhile, moral watchdogs loudly protested darker fare on the album like <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDQv54NwqX0">"97 Bonnie and Clyde"</a> , in which Eminem sings lovingly to his baby daughter while en route to dump her murdered mother in a body of water.

			<h3>The Marshall Mathers LP (2000-2002)</h3>
			<div class="image"><img src="images/themarshalllpcareer.jpg" alt="The Marshall LP"></div>
			<p>Eminem started his journey towards the fame he deserved by representing himself as an unstoppable rapper who would attack and offend anything in his way. His album <a  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marshall_Mathers_LP">Marshall Mathers LP</a> was released in May 2000 and it ranked in top chart with over 1.7 million copies sold instore in first week of sales. This album eventually sold over 10 million copies and achieved diamond certification. This album also broke the record held by <a  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg">Snoop Dogg</a> and <a  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears">Britney Spears</a> for fastest selling hip-hop album.</p>
			<h3>Encore (2003-2007):</h3>
			<div class="image"><img src="images/encore.jpg" alt="Encore Image"></div>
			<p>On December 8, 2003, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.secretservice.gov/"> United States Secret Service </a> said that it was "looking into" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States. The cause for concern was the lyrics of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHImGrckyLE" target="_blank" >"We As Americans"</a>. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/Encore" target="_blank">Encore </a>, released in 2004, was another success. Its sales were partially driven by the first single,<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dcVOmEQzKA" target="_blank"> "Just Lose It"</a>, which contained slurs about Michael Jackson. Many of Jackson's friends and supporters spoke out against the video. Also, Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song <a href="https://vimeo.com/27790825" target="_blank">"Mosh"</a>. The song criticized President George W. Bush as "This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president".In 2005, industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering ending his rapping career after six years and several Multi-Platinum albums. The day of 6th December, 2005,<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/curtain-call-the-hits-20060112" target="_blank"> Curtain Call: The Hits's</a> released, Eminem appeared on WKQI's "Mojo in the Morning" show. Denying that he was retiring, he suggested he would take a break as an artist. During its first week, Curtain Call sold nearly 441,000 copies in the US, and was Eminem's fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard Hot 200. The album has been certified double platinum by the <a href="https://www.riaa.com" target="_blank">RIAA</a>.</p>
			<h3>Relapse and Refill (2008–2009):</h3>

Relapse was named one of the top albums of 2009, and has sold more than five million copies worldwide. On November 19, he announced on his website that <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/Relapse:+Refill" target="_blank">Relapse: Refill</a> would be released on December 21.
