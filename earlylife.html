				<h3>Early Life</h3>
				<div class="image"><img alt="Eminem Childhood" src="images/eminemChildhood.jpg"></div>
				<p>Marshall Mathers (Eminem) was born in St.Joseph, Missouri, USA on October 17th, 1972. He was the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers and Deborah Rae “Debbie” Nelson. Eminem’s mother was only 17 when she gave birth and she nearly died during her 73 hour labour. Eminem’s parents were also in a band called Daddy Warbucks before their separation. Bruce moved to California and Debbie later had a son named Nathan Kane Samara known as Nate. During childhood, they kept moving from places to places. They rarely stayed at one place for more than 2 years. They lived at several places in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas city.</p>
				<h3>Eminem's Childhood</h3>
				<p>Friends and family remember Eminem as a “happy child”. But this wasn’t the truth. According to his mother Eminem wrote several letters to his father but all of them came back marked as “return to sender”. Eminem had a very tough childhood and he was a bit of a loner too. He was often bullied during his childhood. Once a bully named De’Angelo Bailey injured Eminem’s head badly in school, Debbie filed a lawsuit to sue the school in 1982 which was rejected next year. He spent most of his childhood in Detroit in a lower-middle class neighbourhood. Eminem was also beaten several times by black youth when he was a child.</p>
				<h3>Personal Interest</h3>
				<p>His personal interest as a child was storytelling and comic book artist before discovering Hip-hop. Eminem heard his first rap soundtrack <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Mc3pTmiCHI">“Reckless” (featuring Ice-T)</a> which was a gift from Debbie’s half brother, Ronnie Polkinghorn. Ronnie committed suicide in 1991, this made Eminem very upset. He did not attend his funereal and did not speak for days. Eminem disliked maths and social studies but he had interest in English. After spending three years in 9th grade and because of poor grades, Eminem was dropped out of Lincoln High School at the age of 17.</p>
				<h3>Hip-hop & Rapping</h3>
				<p>Eminem first started rapping at the age of 14 with his school friend, Mike Ruby. They adopted names from themselves as “Manix” and “M&M”. Eminem used to sneak up in other neighbouring schools with friends to do freestyle rap battles. He also used to attend open mic contest at Hip-hop shop on West 7 mile. Eminem was widely appreciated by audience. Eminem’s wrote verses that were words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes. This practice is one of the key for his success until today.</p>
