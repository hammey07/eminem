		<h3>Early Years 1987-1994</h3>
		<p>Eminem was married twice to Kimberly Anne “Kim” Scott. Eminem and Kim first met in 1987 at the home of a mutual friend while he was rapping LL Cool J’s "<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Bad">I'm bad</a>" standing on a table. Eminem was only 15 and Kim was 13 when they first met. They both fell in love and Kim ran away from home same year to live with Eminem and was taken in by Eminem’s mother, Debbie.</p>
		<h3>Only Child</h3>
		<p><a  target="_blank" href="http://eminem.wikia.com/wiki/Hailie_Jade_Mathers">Hailie Jade Scott Mathers</a>, was the only child of Kim and Marshall. Hailie was born on Christmas day in 1995. The care needed to look after the first child inspired Eminem to do better for his daughter and this nearly ended his career.</p>
		<div class="quote">
			<q>Mazur, Eminem’s manager at the restaurant, says Eminem even gave up music to support his family. Although Eminem had been fired a few times for tardiness and other minor offenses — he was once canned shortly before Christmas — Mazur says he became a model employee. He recalls a six-month period shortly after Hailie’s birth when Eminem worked 60 hours a week. "He didn’t want his daughter to grow up like he did living from day to day and moving from week to week", Mazur says.</q>

		<p>The addition of Hailie did put a lot of pressure on Kim’s and Marshall’s relationship. The couple briefly split in 1996 and Kim took Hailie with herself to live in a one bedroom apartment. Eminem moved back in with his mother and later wrote a details song “Mockingbird” about this period.</p>

		</div>
		<p>All this anger and resentment and the fact that he couldn’t seem to escape his low rent lifestyle led to his famous creation of alter-ego Slim Shady.</p>
		<h3>First Marriage</h3>
		<div class="image"><img alt="Eminem & Kim" src="images/couple.jpg"></div>
		<p>Kim and Marshall were married again in 1999 in St. Joseph, Mo. The marriage lasted two years ending in spring 2001. Also, in June 2000, Marshall seen Kim kissing a friend on cheek in a parking lot at a nightclub. Eminem assaulted the man and got arrested for it which made him receiving a sentence of two years’ probation.</p>
		<h3>Suicide Attempt</h3>
		<p>In an interview with <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRExjF0dSQo">20/20</a> in 2007, Kim detailed a suicide attempt when she went to Eminem’s concert in Detroit in July 2000. She even asked him if he was going to play the song “Kim” and he said “no” to her. But Eminem did play the song and assaulted a blow-up doll stand-in for Kim, to a rapturous response from the crowd.</p>
		<p>After the performance of Eminem’s murderous track Kim drove back home and slit her wrist as it was too much for her and she couldn’t take it anymore. Eminem filed divorce next month. Kim filed her own divorce papers in early 2001. Kim also sued eminem for defamation after he discribed her voilent death in the song <a  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_(song)">"Kim"</a>.</p>
		<h3>Second Marriage</h3>
		<p>Even so, the couple briefly remarried in January of 2006 on the 15th anniversary of the day they began dating. Kim was skeptical from the start, and attempted to convince Eminem not to sign the marriage license. Their second marriage lasted until April, when Em filed for divorce and agreed to joint custody of Hailie.</p>
		<h3>Eminem & Kim Today</h3>
		<div class="image"><img alt="Eminem & Kim" src="images/eminemkim.jpg"></div>
		<p>Kim mentioned Eminem as an “Excellent father” in the same interview of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRExjF0dSQo">20/20</a> in 2007. There is no chance for this couple to get together. Eminem also came off with apologetic behaviour towards his ex-wife in his several songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ9_TKayu9s" target="_blank" >“Cleanin’ out my Closet”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelHwf8o7_U" target="_blank"> “Love the Way you lie”</a>.</p>
		<p>Eminem and Kim Scott went through a lot of troubles, struggles and responsibilities they had for the child together and this creates an inspiring and most innovative discography in the history of hip-hop.</p>
