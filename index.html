					<p>The term ‘Hero’ can be defined as “a person who is admired for their courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities”. As human beings we are always looking for someone that inspires us, we are always looking for someone to look up to. These people who are considered as heroes among us are the people who have the ability to inspires us. To me, a hero is someone who starts off with nothing but makes something amazing out of their situation.</p>
					<p>My personal hero is Marshall Mathers III, also known as his stage name Eminem. You might be surprised what life he had and what he made out his life. Marshall was born in a poor home on October 17th 1972, in Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.A. His mother Debbie Briggs-Mathers was alcoholic and his father Marshall Mathers II left family because of poverty when Eminem was born. Because of poor situation, Eminem and Debbie had to switch houses constantly. They finally settled in Detroit, a place where drugs, violence and murders were common. Eminem was also bullied a lot and also got beaten up many times. He also got dropped out of school after failing 9th grade three times. In his musical rapping career he also got neglected and ignored first as he was white and everybody refused to believe that he could rap. When Eminem and his wife Kim had her first child Hailey, Eminem worked over-time and struggled very hard to provide a better life for Hailey. During this time their house got robbed several times and Kim decided to move out with Hailey in a different apartment. This unleashed the best skills Eminem had of writing lyrics. Eminem actually tells us this story about the hard times he had in his songs. In his song <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ9_TKayu9s">Cleaning out the closet</a> he describes what his life went through, he also tells us the hate he has against his father and mother for not being a good mom to him, he also describes that he can never think of doing that to Hailey what his father did to him. He struggled all his early life through all these situations but he changed those situations by using his skills in the best way and now he is one of the best rapper with net worth of $201 Million according to <a target="_blank" href="http://coed.com/2015/10/20/eminem-net-worth-how-much-slim-shady-worth-today-rapper-marshall-mathers-money/">COED.com</a>.</p><img src="images/eminem8mile.jpg" alt="Eminem 8 mile">
					<p>The reason what makes me call him a Hero is that with all those hard times he still managed to put himself in a place where he truely deserves. Also, In my opinion Eminem is only one of the few rappers who can actually turn a story into rap song. His most songs are based on his true life events. In his most songs he expresses his own thoughts and opinion in a rhythm using his skills at best. He only cares about his own opinion and no one's else. If you have heard about his struggles and hardships in his childhood, that is because he wanted you to know through his music. Most of his life stories are from his songs which are based on true life events.</p>
					<p>All these characteristics makes him very unique to others. This makes him a "Hero" to many people like us.</p>
